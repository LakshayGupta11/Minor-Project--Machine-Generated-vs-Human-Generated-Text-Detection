# Minor-Project- Machine Generated vs Human Generated Text Detection

In this project we seek create a model which can detect and flag machine generated text. For this, we have used data made available from various resources like Kaggle, GitHub as well as collecting responses after giving prompts to LLM models like GPT and BARD. 

Machine Generated Text is becoming increasingly common in a variety of applications, such as news articles, social media posts, and product descriptions. However, Machine Generated Text can also be used for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or propaganda.

In this minor project we have developed a machine learning model to detect Machine Generated Text. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled text, including both Machine Generated Text and human-generated text. The model will then be used to predict whether a new piece of text is Machine Generated Text or not.

The project uses a variety of machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. The NLP techniques will be used to extract features from the text, such as the length of the sentences, the complexity of the vocabulary, and the presence of certain patterns. The deep learning techniques will be used to train a model to predict whether the text is Machine generated Text or not based on the extracted features.

## Introduction

Over the past few years, machine-generated text has risen to popularity and received heavy improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Nowadays it is safe to say that it is beyond the scope of human intelligence to detect the minute differences between text that is human-generated and text that a machine has created. However, this potent technology also introduces potential misuse and societal implications, including privacy violations, misinformation, and integrity and originality challenges in academia.
In an era characterized by an ever-expanding digital landscape and an exponential increase in textual data, the ability to discern between human-generated and machine-generated text has become a critical challenge. The phenomenon of generating text through artificial intelligence (AI) models has proliferated across various domains, from content generation and chatbots to misinformation and deepfake production. As a result, the need for robust and reliable "Machine Generated Text Detection" has emerged as a pressing concern in both technological and societal contexts.
This minor project aims to delve into the intricate world of identifying machine-generated text amidst the vast ocean of digital content. The machine-generated text encompasses a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from algorithmically produced news articles to automated social media posts and spam emails. Detecting such text is vital for safeguarding the integrity of information dissemination, maintaining trust in online interactions, and mitigating the risks associated with AI-generated content, such as misinformation and cyber threats.
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate text detection system that can distinguish between human and machine-generated text. This system will employ cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine
learning algorithms, and deep neural networks to analyze and classify text data. By doing so, it will contribute to enhancing the digital ecosystem's authenticity and security.
This introductory phase will provide an overview of the project's significance, objectives, and methodologies. Subsequent sections will delve into the theoretical foundations, dataset preparation, model development, and evaluation metrics, offering a comprehensive insight into the journey of creating a robust "Machine Generated Text Detection" solution. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide a valuable contribution to the ongoing efforts to safeguard the integrity of textual information in an AI-driven world.
